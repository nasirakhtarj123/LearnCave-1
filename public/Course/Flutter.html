        <p>Flutter is Google’s Mobile SDK to build native iOS and Android, Desktop (Windows, Linux, macOS), and Web apps from a single codebase. When building applications with Flutter everything towards Widgets – the blocks with which the flutter apps are built. They are structural elements that ship with a bunch of material design-specific functionalities and new widgets can be composed out of existing ones too. The process of composing widgets together is called composition. The User Interface of the app is composed of many simple widgets, each of them handling one particular job. That is the reason why Flutter developers tend to think of their flutter app as a tree of widgets.</p>

            Container class in Flutter:
        </h3>
        <p>Container class in flutter is a convenience widget that combines common painting, positioning, and sizing of widgets. A Container class can be used to store one or more widgets and position them on the screen according to our convenience. Basically, a container is like a box to store contents. A basic container element that stores a widget has a margin, which separates the present container from other contents. The total container can be given a border of different shapes, for example, rounded rectangles, etc. A container surrounds its child with padding and then applies additional constraints to the padded extent (incorporating the width and height as constraints, if either is non-null).</p>

It will occupy the available space. Scaffold will provide a framework to implement the basic material design layout of the application. </p>
