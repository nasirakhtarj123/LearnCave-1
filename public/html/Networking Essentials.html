        <h1 class="mainHeading bigText">Networking Essentials</h1>
        <h3 class="sub-heading">
            <b>Introduction</b>
        </h3>
        <div class="para">

        
        <p>Computer networking has existed for many years, and as time has passed the technologies have become faster and less expensive. Networks are made up of various devices—computers, switches, routers—connected together by cables or wireless signals. Understanding the basics of how networks are put together is an important step in building a wireless network in a community or neighborhood.</p>
        <h3 class="sub-headding">
            Clients and Servers
        </h3>
        <p>An important relationship on networks is that of the server and the client. A server is a computer that holds content and services such as a website, a media file, or a chat application. A good example of a server is the computer that holds the website for Google’s search page: http://www.google.com. The server holds that page, and sends it out when requested.</p>
        <p>A client is a different computer, such as your laptop or cell phone, that requests to view, download, or use the content. The client can connect over a network to exchange information. For instance, when you request Google’s search page with your web browser, your computer is the client.</p>
        <p>Most requests and content delivery on networks are similar to, or are based on, a client to server relationship. On a network, the server can be located almost anywhere, and if the client has the address, it can access the content on the server.</p>
        
        <h3 class="sub-heading">
            IP Addresses
        </h3>
        <p>In order to send and direct data across a network, computers need to be able to identify destinations and origins. This identification is an IP—Internet Protocol—address. An IP address is just a set of four numbers between 1 and 254, separated by dots. An example of an IP address is 173.194.43.7.</p>
        <p>An IP address is similar to a street address. Parts of the address describe where in the world the building is located, another part narrows it down to a state or city, then the area within that state or city, then the location on the street.</p>
        <p>There are different classifications, or types of IP addresses. A network can be public, or it can be private. Public IP addresses are accessible anywhere on the Internet. Private IP addresses are not, and most are typically hidden behind a device with a public IP address.</p>
        <p>The postal building controls messages that travel between the Internet and the street, keeping track of messages that leave the street, and directs return messages to the right house. On the street, it has the address 192.168.1.1, and on the Internet it has the address 74.10.10.50.</p>
        <h3 class="sub-heading">
            Network Hubs and Switches
        </h3>
        <p>Traditionally, computers are connected to each other using cables—creating a network. The cable used most often is Ethernet, which consists of four pairs of wires inside of a plastic jacket. It is physically similar to phone cables, but can transport much more data.</p>
        <p>
            But cables and computers alone do not make a good network, so one early solution was to use a network hub. The Ethernet cables from the computer connect to the device similar to the hub of a bike wheel—where all of the spokes come together in the center.
        </p>
        <p>An example of how a hub works is shown below. Computer A wants to send a message to computer B. It sends the message through the Ethernet cable to the hub, then the hub repeats the message to all of the connected computers.</p>
        <p>A network using a hub can slow down if many computers are sending messages, since they may try and send messages at the same time and confuse the hub. To help with this problem, networks began to use another device called a switch. Instead of repeating all messages that come in, a switch only sends the message to the intended destination. This eliminates the unnecessary repetition of the hub.</p>
        <p>Using a switch, computer A sends a message to computer B—the other computers do not see the message. Those computers can send other messages at the same time without interfering.</p>
        <p>Switches do have a limitation though—they only know about the addresses of equipment that is plugged directly into them. So, you can only send messages to a small number of devices—however many ports the switch has! If you need to send a message to a computer on another network, it will need to be sent through a router, which we discuss next.</p>
        <h3 class="sub-heading">Routers and Firewalls</h3>
        <p>Routers do the majority of the hard work on a network - they make the decisions about all the messages that travel on the network, and whether to pass messages to and from outside networks.</p>
        <h3 class="sub-heading">
            Definitions
        </h3>
        <ul>
            <h2 class="types">DHCP—Dynamic Host Configuration Protocol</h2>
            <p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;It assigns IP addresses to client devices, such as desktop computers, laptops, and phones, when they are plugged into Ethernet or connect to Wireless networks.</p>
            <h2 class="types">DHCP—Dynamic Host Configuration Protocol</h2>
            <p>A type of networking protocol—it defines the types of cables and connections that are used to wire computers, switches, and routers together. Most often Ethernet cabling is Category 5 or 6, made up of twisted pair wiring similar to phone cables.</p>
            <h2 class="types">
                Hub
            </h2>
            <p>A network device that repeats the traffic it receives to all connected devices.</p>
            <h2 class="types">
                Switch
            </h2>
            <p>A network device that sends traffic it receives to a specific connected device, such as a single desktop computer or laptop.</p>
            <h2 class="types">
                Router
            </h2>
            <p>A network device that can bridge between different networks, determine what traffic can pass between them, and perform other functions on a network, such as assigning IP addresses.</p>
        </ul>
